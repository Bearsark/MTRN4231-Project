COMPUTER VISION SUBSYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When updating the nodes from this subsystem, you may have to delete the build, install and log folders and "colcon build" before running.
Errors may appear if you don't. Don't forget to source.

CAMERA POSITION AND SETUP:
Camera setup height: 62 cm
Length from robot base to camera stand: 139 cm
Y-axis offset of robot base from camera stand: 10 cm
Camera angle from horizontal: -50 degrees

URDF SETUP:
1) In "setupRealur5e.sh", 
gnome-terminal -t "DriverServer" -e 'ros2 launch ur_robot_driver ur_control.launch.py ur_type:=ur5e robot_ip:=192.168.0.100 initial_joint_controller:=joint_trajectory_controller use_fake_hardware:=false launch_rviz:=false'



sleep 10



gnome-terminal -t "MoveitServer" -e 'ros2 launch ur_moveit_config ur_moveit.launch.py robot_ip:=192.168.0.100 ur_type:=ur5e launch_rviz:=true description_package:=ur_with_pizza_cutter_description description_file:=ur_with_pizza_cutter.xacro'

in 
"Home/4231/4231_demo_packages/src"

need folders
"pizza_cutter"
"ur_with_pizza_cutter"

from vincents laptop





LAUNCH FILE SETUP:
To run all the nodes instantaneously when using the Intel Realsense camera, use:
	"ros2 launch cv_bringup cv_bringup.launch.py"
To quickly set up the RViz display, open the "cv_rviz_config.rviz" RViz config file.


MANUAL SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
Each of the following should be run in seperate terminals. Do NOT include the quotation marks (") when running commands.

1) To run the camera node:
   IF USING THE STANDARD MICROSOFT CAMERA:
	"ros2 run v4l2_camera v4l2_camera_node"
   If an error appears, try restarting the computer. If that doesn't work, run the following
   before trying again:
	"qv4l2 -R -d /dev/video0"

   IF USING THE ASTRA DEPTH CAMERA:
	"ros2 launch astra_camera astra_pro.launch.py"
   Make the sure astra camera files are installed, and that the workspace name does NOT have spaces! E.g. "Bottle_Flip_Project". If using the other astra camera, replace astra_pro with astra_mini.

   IF USING THE INTEL REALSENSE CAMERA:
	"ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py enable_rgbd:=true enable_sync:=true align_depth.enable:=true pointcloud.enable:=true depth_module.profile:=1280x720x15 rgb_camera.profile:=1280x720x15"
   If this doesn't work, make sure the computer has installed the files properly. Look at the ed forum for the install code.

2) To get Yolo trained with bottle images:
	"yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8n.pt imgsz=640 data=my_dataset.yaml epochs=10 batch=1 name=bottle_detection"
   Make sure you are in the directory of my_dataset.yaml when you run this. If it still doesn't work, try run:
	"rm /home/mtrn/.config/Ultralytics/settings.yaml"

3) To run the Yolov8 node:
   IF USING THE STANDARD MICROSOFT CAMERA:
	"ros2 launch yolov8_bringup yolov8.launch.py input_image_topic:='/image_raw' device:='cpu'"

   IF USING THE ASTRA DEPTH CAMERA:
	"ros2 launch yolov8_bringup yolov8_3d.launch.py input_image_topic:='/camera/color/image_raw' device:='cpu' target_frame:='camera_link' model:='yolov8n.pt'"
   If the above has problems, the astra camera setup files may not be installed properly. Yolo needs to be configured to use it.

   IF USING THE INTEL REALSENSE CAMERA:
	"ros2 launch yolov8_bringup yolov8_3d.launch.py input_image_topic:='/camera/color/image_raw' input_depth_topic:='/camera/aligned_depth_to_color/image_raw' device:='cpu' target_frame:='base_frame' model:='yolov8n.pt'"

4) To run Rviz with Yolo:
	"ros2 run rviz2 rviz2"
   Subscribe to the topic:
	- /yolo/dbg_image (for yolo overlay on image)
	- /yolo/dgb_bb_markers (to show bounding boxes on Rviz)
   If using depth camera, you must also subscribe to the depth cloud topic with "PointCloud2".
   The above setup can be skipped if you open the "cv_rviz_config.rviz" RViz config file.

5) To run the computer vision post processing node, use the command:
	"ros2 run cv_post_process post_process"
   cv_post_process is the package name, post_process is the executable name.

6) To run the static transformation node, use the command:
	"ros2 run static_tf static"
