MACHINE VISION NODE INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When installing this project on a fresh computer, you might have to delete the build, install and log folders before running "colcon build" again. Errors may appear if you don't. Don't forget to source.

Setup Instructions:
Each of the following should be run in seperate terminals. Do NOT include the quotation marks (") when running commands.

1) To run the camera node:
   IF USING THE STANDARD MICROSOFT CAMERA:
	"ros2 run v4l2_camera v4l2_camera_node"
   If an error appears, try restarting the computer. If that doesn't work, run the following
   before trying again:
	"qv4l2 -R -d /dev/video0"

   IF USING THE ASTRA DEPTH CAMERA:
	"ros2 launch astra_camera astra_pro.launch.py"
   Make the sure astra camera files are installed, and that the workspace name does NOT have spaces! E.g. "Bottle_Flip_Project"
   
2) To run the Yolov8 node:
   IF USING THE STANDARD MICROSOFT CAMERA:
	"ros2 launch yolov8_bringup yolov8.launch.py input_image_topic:='/image_raw' device:='cpu'"

   IF USING THE ASTRA DEPTH CAMERA:
	"ros2 launch yolov8_bringup yolov8_3d.launch.py input_image_topic:='/camera/color/image_raw' device:='cpu' target_frame:='camera_link' model:='yolov8n.pt'"
   If the above has problems, the astra camera setup files may not be installed properly. Yolo needs to be configured to use it.

3) To run Rviz with Yolo:
	"ros2 run rviz2 rviz2"
   Subscribe to the topic:
	- /yolo/dbg_image (for yolo overlay on image)

   IF USING ASTRA DEPTH CAMERA:
   Also subscribe to the topics:
	- /camera/depth/points under "By display type > PointCloud2" (to show point cloud on Rviz)
	- /yolo/dgb_bb_markers (to show bounding boxes on Rviz)

3) To run the machine vision node, use the command:
	"ros2 run cpp_mac_vis mac_vis"
   cpp_mac_vis is the package name, mac_vis is the executable name.
